# Google-Analytics-Certificate-Cyclist-Case-Study

  This repository was created to host the documentation and files related to the Cyclist Case Study, one of the works required to obtain the Google Analytics Certificate.

# About the Analysis

  In this analysis, the role of a hypothetical data analyst, part of the marketing analytics team, was to identify the defining characteristics of different types of customers of a bikeshare company, fictionally called "Cyclist," including members and casual riders.
  The company aims to better understand its customers, as members generate more profit for the company than casual riders. The most significant trend identified is that member riders likely use bikes as a means of commuting to work, while casual riders use bikes for leisure.
  As concluded, it is recommended that the marketing team should focus their advertising on casual riders, emphasizing the benefits of using bikes for commuting and encouraging them to become members.
The next steps should focus on gathering more data to gain a deeper understanding of casual riders' behavior and to discover why they do not choose biking as a means of commuting to work.

# About the Files and Data Structure

  The files that may be initially found are those used to document the entire workflow. The R-related files include those where the preparation, processing, and pre-analysis have been conducted. Excel and Tableau files contain the analysis itself, with many visual resources. The "Images," and "Documentation" for the analysis process are in files with the same name. All these files should be read in conjunction with the text file found in "Documentation" named "Cyclist Analysis Documentation.docx". The "Data" folder used on the local analysis has not been uploaded given its big size. The original data should be found on zip format on: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html. Following the markdown workflow over those dataframe would be no problem, then you get the dataframes generated as part of this work.
